# WP Dashboard Support
A WordPress plugin that adds an easy way for people to contact their developer from the admin dashboard.

Should help you keep clients since they'll be able to just contact you right away without giving them 
a chance to go to their email and see other developers and at the same time sending you an email with
a bunch of diagnostic info that should help know where they are with their website.

Try it out and let me know what you think!

Any suggestions? You can reach me from my website http://www.moeloubani.com
